 je_two_canadas:0 "A Tale of Two Canadas"
 je_two_canadas_reason:0 "Inspired by revolutions across the Americas, the British subjects in Upper and Lower Canada dream of a free Canadian republic with responsible governance. These Pro-Republican groups are prepared to fight for their freedom, while the redcoat Loyalists look to tighten their grip on the young colonies.\n\nIn Lower Canada, a coalition of landed French *seigneurs* and British merchants known as the Chateau Clique offer a traditional British oppression, opposed by the Intelligentsia and Louis-Joseph Papineau's Patriote Party, who seek aid wherever they can find it.\n\nFurther up the St. Lawrence, the Family Compact rules Upper Canada's York legislature with an iron fist. Their increasingly dominant control over the anglophone population has inspired William Lyon Mackenzie to stage a rebellion in favour of a Republic of Canada.\n\nWill you side with the emerging aristocracy or the radical republicans? Your choice will determine the fate of the colonists, and set a new destiny for all of British North America."
